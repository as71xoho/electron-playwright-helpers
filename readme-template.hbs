# Electron Playwright Helpers

Helper functions to make it easier to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end testing with
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). Parse packaged Electron projects so you can run tests on them. Click Electron
menu items, send IPC messages, get menu structures, etc.

## Installation

```shell
npm i -D electron-playwright-helpers
```

## Usage

For a full example of how to use this library, see the 
[electron-playwright-example](https://github.com/spaceagetv/electron-playwright-example) project.
But here's a quick example:

Javascript:

```JS
const eph = require('electron-playwright-helpers')
// - or cherry pick -
const { findLatestBuild, parseElectronApp, clickMenuItemById } = require('electron-playwright-helpers')

let electronApp: ElectronApplication

test.beforeAll(async () => {
  // find the latest build in the out directory
  const latestBuild = findLatestBuild()
  // parse the packaged Electron app and find paths and other info
  const appInfo = parseElectronApp(latestBuild)
  electronApp = await electron.launch({
    args: [appInfo.main], // main file from package.json
    executablePath: appInfo.executable // path to the Electron executable
  })
})

test.afterAll(async () => {
  await electronApp.close()
})

test('click menu item', async () => {
  await eph.clickMenuItemById(electronApp, 'newproject')
})

```

Typescript:

```TS
import * as eph from 'electron-playwright-helpers'
// - or cherry pick -
import { electronWaitForFunction, ipcMainCallFirstListener, clickMenuItemById } from 'electron-playwright-helpers'

// then same as Javascript above
```
